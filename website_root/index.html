                        <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">
                            Hatched in Scarborough
                            and grew up in Cambridge, Ontario.  Started programming
                            BASIC when I was 8 years old.  I learned some networking,
                            tech support and some C programming while in high school.
                            By the end of high school I had spent so much time with
                            computers that I really wanted a change and so I became a
                            chef.
                        </p>
                        <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">
                            Worked a a number of
                            restaurants in Kitchener and Waterloo including
                            apprenticing at the best restaurant in town and later
                            running a kitchen as a head chef.  After most of a decade
                            in the restaurant industry I was ready for a change and
                            got a job at BlackBerry.

                            I worked at BlackBerry
                            New Product Realization Centre building pre-production
                            BlackBerry prototypes.  Participated in numerous large
                            scale, high paced projects.  Worked as subject matter
                            expert, technical tester and functional tester for
                            internal projects.  Administered internal issue tracking
                            database.  I - along with most of the NPRC staff - was
                            laid off during the BlackBerry downsizing.

                            Throughout all of my
                            various jobs I had kept up an interest in programming,
                            technology and general geekery.  While working at BlackBerry
                            I started to realize how unusual it was for someone to learn computer
                            languages and tech as a hobby and decided I should put
                            those talents to work.  I am currently studying Video Game
                            Design at Trios College in Kitchener.

                            scratch in about 3 weeks.  All of the assets and game

                            primarily uses method injection in the object prototypes
                            rather than traditional inheritance.

                            This game is a classic style
                            text adventure game written in C++.  The engine is all original.
                            I focused on learning data structure and data driven design.

                            All of the rooms and items in the
                            game are imported when the game starts and built into a tree
                            structure.  Moving around the game world as well as picking up and
                            dropping items is all just moving nodes in the tree.

                            The most interesting feature of
                            this game design is the fact that it uses a dictionary file to
                            build abstract syntax trees that can can interpret and tokenize
                            input.  Two different syntax trees are used.  One is used to tokenize
                            the data files.  The other is used to read and understand player input.
                            This means that adding an alias to an item (e.g. datacable and cable
                            are the same thing) only requires you to add the alias to the
                            dictionary file and restart the game with no code changes required.
