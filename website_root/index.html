                        <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">
                            Throughout all of my
                            various jobs I had kept up an interest in programming,
                            technology and general geekery.  While working at BlackBerry
                            I started to realize how unusual it was for someone to learn computer
                            languages and tech as a hobby and decided I should put
                            those talents to work.  I am currently studying Video Game
                            Design at Trios College in Kitchener, Ontario.
                        </p>

                            Hatched in Scarborough
                            and grew up in Cambridge, Ontario.  Started programming
                            BASIC when I was 8 years old.  I learned some networking,
                            tech support and some C programming while in high school.
                        </p>

                            Worked a a number of
                            restaurants in Kitchener and Waterloo including
                            apprenticing at the best restaurant in town and later
                            running a kitchen as a head chef.  After most of a decade
                            in the restaurant industry I was ready for a change and
                            got a job at BlackBerry.

                            BlackBerry prototypes.  Participated in numerous large
                            scale, high paced projects.  Worked as subject matter
                            expert, technical tester and functional tester for
                            internal projects.  Administered internal issue tracking
                            database.  I - along with most of the NPRC staff - was
                            laid off during the BlackBerry downsizing.

                        <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha omega">
                            Monster Smash is a desktop and mobile game that runs in a browser window written in Javascript and HTML.  The engine was written by me and much of it is reused from my earlier Super Mario 3 game.
                            This game is heavily inspired by the olf Rampage arcade game.
                        </p>
                        <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha omega">
                            There are a few interesting systems built into this game.  The first is the animation pipeline.  The sprites were built in parts preresenting the limbs of the main charator as individual .png files.
                            Each of the body parts is imported into Synfig and built onto a 2D skelton and animated.  The animations are exported and the animation frames are packed into a spritesheet.  This system allowed me to
                            create and import about 200 frames of animation and easily switch between animations using a finite state machine.
                        </p>
                        <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha omega">
                            The second intersesting system of this game is a quad tree broad phase used by the collision code.  The buildings are made up of a grid of colliders.  The quad tree allowed me to have hundreds of colliders on
                            the screen at one time and still keep very good performance even on a phone.

                            This game is a classic Zork style

                            I focused on learning data structure and data driven design.

                            All of the rooms and items in the
                            game are imported when the game starts and built into a tree
                            structure.  The player, the player inventory, the rooms and items are all just nodes in the tree.
                            Moving around the game world as well as picking up and
                            dropping items is all just moving nodes.

                            The most interesting feature of
                            this game design is the fact that it uses a dictionary file to
                            build abstract syntax trees that can can interpret and tokenize
                            input.  Two different syntax trees are used.  One is used to tokenize
                            the data files.  The other is used to read and understand player input.
                            This means that adding an alias to an item (e.g. datacable and cable
                            are the same thing) only requires you to add the alias to the
                            dictionary file and restart the game with no code changes required.
                            Adding an item to the world works the same in that you just edit a data file.
