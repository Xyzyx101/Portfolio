            <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">Hatched in Scarborough and grew up in Cambridge, Ontario.  Started programming BASIC when I was 8 years old.  I learned some networking, tech support and some C programming while in high school.  By the end of high school I had spent so much time with computers that I really wanted a change and so I became a chef.</p>
            <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">Worked a a number of restaurants in Kitchener and Waterloo including apprenticing at the best restaurant in town and later running a kitchen as a head chef.  After most of a decade in the restaurant industry I was ready for a change and got a job at BlackBerry.</p>
            <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">I worked at BlackBerry New Product Realization Centre building pre-production BlackBerry prototypes.  Participated in numerous large scale, high paced projects.  Worked as subject matter expert, technical tester and functional tester for internal projects.  Administered internal issue tracking database.  I - along with most of the NPRC staff - was laid off during the BlackBerry downsizing.</p>
            <p class="grid_7 prefix_1 alpha">Throughout all of my various jobs I had kept up an interest in programming and technology.  While working at BlackBerry I started to realize how unusual it was for someone to learn computer languages and tech as a hobby and I decided I need to put these talents to work.  I am currently studying Video Game Design at Trios College in Kitchener.</p>

Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

            <p class="grid_6 prefix_1 alpha">You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
